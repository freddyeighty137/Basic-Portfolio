					<img src="">

					<p>Hello, my name is Freddy</p>

					<p>

					A few facts about myself. I'm an adrenaline junky and with always having desire to race, and no not nascar, I ride sport bikes. The worst crash I've been in, was an embarrassing, maybe five mile per hour fall, due to loose gravel while I was turning.I live with my girlfriend, lindsey, who is a pre-med student, and I wish I was capable of studying like her. Even with my ADHD medicine, I'm not as dicipline as she is. Currently we both work in the emergency department at Brackenridge. Lindsey is a clerk about to transition in to a tech, or like it says on paper, "clinical assistant". I am a tech at Brack on top of also working with physicians conducting clinical research studies, currently at Dell Children's.

					I live with a cat, named Luther, who per the vet, is overweight. Apperantly he also has a heart murmor and a symptom I need to keep an eye on, is if he becomes lathargic. He's a cat, so not sure how to tell. I also, have a dog, her name is Mia, and being a husky, people either love her or are terriffied of her. Together, the furry-ones makes sure that the aparment get vaccumed almost everyday.
